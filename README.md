## Description
It's my **first** mini game project that I developed with Unity3D to remembering to use the tools of the unity game engine and learning cinemachine. It was made by following Rick Davidson's lecture: [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D series](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) on Udemy and added changes. Source code is provided for educational purposes.
